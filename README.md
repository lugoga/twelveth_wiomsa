## Twelveth WIOMSA Symposium

The Symposium is the premier regional scientific event on the coastal and marine environment. It will showcase insightful and inspiring presentations on the latest research results and key developments in the Western Indian Ocean region.

The Symposium Theme ***A New Decade of Western Indian Ocean Science*** is inspired by the current global and regional goals including the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, the Decade of Ocean Restoration, as well as regional goals. The Symposium will present the most recent advance made in ocean and climate science to address the challenges facing the Western Indian Ocean and to deliver on these goals.

## Objectives
The overarching aim of the 12th WIOMSA Symposium is to mobilize the marine and coastal community behind the ideas of sustainable development and focus the research and technological development in ocean science on existentially important issues of protection and sustainable use of the ocean. The five detailed symposium objectives are outlined below:

+ **Knowledge dissemination**: Present current knowledge on coastal and marine research to support effective decision-making, management, and sustainable development; in disciplines related to the theme of the symposium
+ **Networking**: Promote interaction among social and natural scientists to strengthen multi- and trans-disciplinary research for sustainable management of the coastal and marine environment.
+ **Exchange**: Provide a forum for discussion, exchange of information and experiences on coastal and marine science issues in the region;
+ **Priority mapping**: Identify gaps and priority research areas for improved management of the coastal and marine environment.
+ **Ocean Decade Challenges**:Strengthen regional collaborations among scientists and stakeholders in initiating and cooperating on the co-design of transformative ocean scientific solutions to the Ocean Decade Challenges.
